## Conclusion

The current Next.js implementation successfully captures the core design and structure of hdsok.com. The dark theme with neon green accents is implemented correctly using Tailwind CSS. All major content sections are in place with proper typography, spacing, and responsive design.

The main enhancement needed is adding actual images from the SharePoint folder to replace placeholder text and complete the visual presentation. Once images are added and the dashboard screenshot is in place, the site will be a faithful recreation of the original with improved code structure and maintainability.

Both hdsok.com and hds.live work together as a cohesive ecosystem - one for marketing and information, the other for application functionality. The Next.js site successfully implements the marketing/information hub with room to expand into more advanced features.
